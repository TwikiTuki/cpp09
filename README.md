### C++
This repo shows some exercises for c++. It focuses in [containers](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container), and in each case some kind of [container](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container) is used.

* In exercise one is about [map](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map) containers and is bit coin value calculator.
* In the second one the  [stack](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/stack) container is used in order to implement a simple version of the reverse polish notation.
* In the second one the efficiency of [deque](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/deque) and [vector](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector) are compared when used in an algorithm that sorts some numbers using the merge sort algorithm.
